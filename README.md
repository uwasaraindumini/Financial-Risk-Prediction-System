# Financial-Risk-Prediction-System

📋 **Overview**

The Financial Risk Prediction System is a machine learning-powered application designed to classify individuals into financial risk categories (High, Medium, Low) based on their demographic, financial, and behavioral data. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to provide financial institutions with actionable insights, enabling better lending decisions and risk management.

Deployed Application: Streamlit App

🚀 **Key Features**

1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

• Treated missing values using stratified median imputation.

• Addressed class imbalance with ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling).

• Converted categorical data into numerical format using OrdinalEncoder and LabelEncoder.
    
2️⃣ Feature Scaling & Selection
    
•  Scaled numerical features with MaxAbsScaler to standardize data.

• Identified critical features using Mutual Information (MI) scores, optimizing the dataset for training.
    
3️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation
    
• Trained and evaluated XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, and RandomForest models.

• Fine-tuned hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV to enhance performance.

• Selected XGBoost as the best-performing model for deployment.
    
4️⃣ Deployment

• Deployed the application with a Streamlit interface, providing real-time predictions.

• Saved the trained model, encoders, and scalers as Pickle files for easy reuse.

📊 **Project Workflow**

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the dataset.
    
2. Feature engineering and selection for optimized training.
    
3. Model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
    
4. Deployment of the final model with a user-friendly Streamlit interface.
